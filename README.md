This project is a simple data dashboard built using Streamlit, allowing users to upload CSV files and visualize the data through interactive filtering and plotting. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for data exploration and analysis.

Features:
File Upload: Users can upload CSV files directly through the interface.
Data Preview: Displays the first few rows of the uploaded dataset for quick inspection.
Data Summary: Provides descriptive statistics of the dataset, helping users understand key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
Data Filtering: Users can filter the dataset based on unique values from any selected column, making it easy to analyze specific subsets of data.
Data Visualization: Users can select columns to plot a line chart, allowing for visual insights into the relationships between different variables.
Technologies Used:
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Although imported, the project currently uses Streamlit's built-in plotting functions. (Consider replacing the import matplotlib as plt with import matplotlib.pyplot as plt if you plan to use matplotlib plots directly).
This project serves as a great introduction to data visualization and web application development using Python.
